Don't want nobody else around me
Just need you right here
You're like the only thing that I see
It's crystal-clear, and I

I want you to come claim it, I do
What are you waitin' for?
Yeah, want you to name it, I do
Want you to make it yours

It's like supernatural
This love's possessin' me, but I don't mind at all
It's like supernatural
It's takin' over me, don't wanna fight the fall
It's like supernatural
(This love's possessin' me, but I don't mind at all) mmm
It's like supernatural (oh)
(This love's possessin' me, but I don't mind at all) mmm

Need your hands all up on my body
Like the moon needs the stars (like the moon needs the stars)
Nothin' else felt this way inside me
Boy, let's go too far

I want you to come claim it, I do
What are you waitin' for? (Ooh)
Yeah, want you to name it, I do
Want you to make it yours
It's like supernatural
This love's possessin' me, but I don't mind at all
It's like supernatural
It's takin' over me, don't wanna fight the fall
It's like supernatural
(This love's possessin' me, but I don't mind at all) no, I don't even mind at all, mmm
It's like supernatural
(This love's possessin' me, but I don't mind at all) no, I don't even mind at all

Yeah (yeah), mmm
I want you to come claim it, I do (do)
(I do, I do, do)
You to come name it, I do (do)

This love's possessin' me, but I don't mind at all
It's like supernatural
It's takin' over me, don't wanna fight the fall
It's like supernatural
(This love's possessin' me, but I don't mind at all) no, I don't even mind at all, mmm
It's like supernatural (ooh)
(This love's possessin' me, but I don't mind at all) no, I don't even mind at all
